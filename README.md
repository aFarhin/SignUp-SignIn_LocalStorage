#SignUp-SignIn_LocalStorage

This project is a simple user authentication form that allows users to sign up and sign in using their email and password.
It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create two forms - one for sign up and one for sign in - and uses Local Storage to store user information.

Users can toggle the visibility of their password using an eye icon. 
When the icon is clicked, the password input field changes from type "password" to type "text", revealing the password as plain text.

The project also includes a welcome message that is displayed after a successful sign-in.
